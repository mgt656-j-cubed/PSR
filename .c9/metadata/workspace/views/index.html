We had our first sprint planning on Thursday, January 29. During this meeting, we went through each and every user story, elaborated on the work that needed to be done, agreed on a definition of done, assigned \"difficulty levels\"/story points for each, and then split the work among ourselves. At the same meeting, we set down our schedules for (virtual) daily standup meetings, a retrospective, and a sprint demo.</p>","                <p>From the list above, you'll probably notice that we have finished quite a good amount of work during this sprint, and this is due to our (mis)understanding of the project instructions. When we saw <code>S1-A</code> to <code>S1-F</code> in the project site, we assumed that all those user stories were due for Sprint 1. It was only much later when we asked the TAs and realized that videos to complete some of the user stories have not yet been posted that we were in fact moving way faster than was needed.</p>","                <p>We struggled a lot with merging branches, and that hampered us from moving forward with the project. All of us are fairly new with Git (and even programming in general), so the learning curve was to be expected"]},{"start":{"row":65,"column":31},"end":{"row":69,"column":186},"action":"insert","lines":["reation validation now exists and passes all tests</li>","                </ul>","                <p>Most (if not all) of the project headstart that we had gained during the previous week are gone, as we used most of the time this week to squash bugs.</p>","                <p>We faltered in daily scrums.
